# Comunica AMF Experiments

This repository contains experiments that evaluate the performance of _Approximate Membership Functions (AMFs)_.
On the one hand, AMFs are implemented and exposed in various ways by [`ldf-server`](https://github.com/LinkedDataFragments/Server.js/tree/feature-handlers-amf-2).
On the other hand, different algorithms are implemented for optimizing client-side query evaluation for in [Comunica engines](https://github.com/comunica/comunica-feature-amf).

These experiment were created with [Comunica Bencher](https://github.com/comunica/comunica-bencher).
More information on each experiments, and how to run it, can be found inside the README file for each experiment in the [`experiments`](https://github.com/comunica/Experiments-AMF/tree/master/experiments) folder.

Script for running the statistical tests on the results can be found in the [`analysis/*`](https://github.com/comunica/Experiments-AMF/tree/master/analysis) folders.

## Experiments

We introduce the following experiment groups, each having one or more concrete experiments.

1. **Client-side AMF Algorithms**: Evaluation of different client-side algorithms for using AMF metadata.
    * [Client algorithms](https://github.com/comunica/Experiments-AMF/tree/master/experiments/client_algos): Different client-side AMF filter algorithms compared.
    * [Skip BGP heuristic](https://github.com/comunica/Experiments-AMF/tree/master/experiments/skip_bgp_heuristic): Different constants for the BGP actor-skipping heurtistic are compared.
    * [Filter types](https://github.com/comunica/Experiments-AMF/tree/master/experiments/filter_types): Different AMF filter implementations (Bloom, GCS) are exposed server-side.
2. **Caching**: Evaluating the effects of caching TPFs and AMF filters.
    * [Caching with client-side AMF](https://github.com/comunica/Experiments-AMF/tree/master/experiments/caching): The effects of caching TPFs and AMF filters are evaluated.
    * [Caching without client-side AMF](https://github.com/comunica/Experiments-AMF/tree/master/experiments/caching_none): The effects of caching TPFs without AMF filters are evaluated.
    * [Warm vs Cold Cache](https://github.com/comunica/Experiments-AMF/tree/master/experiments/warm_cold_cache): Comparing the effects of a warm and cold HTTP and AMF Filter cache.
3. **Dynamically Enabling AMF**: Evaluation of dynamically enabling AMF metadata.
    * [Server metadata enabled](https://github.com/comunica/Experiments-AMF/tree/master/experiments/server_metadata_enabled): AMF metadata dynamically enabled or disabled based on the number of matches (NGINX cache is disabled).
4. **HTTP Bandwidths**: Evaluation of different network bandwidths.
    * [Delay](https://github.com/comunica/Experiments-AMF/tree/master/experiments/delay): The effects of different network delays are evaluated.
5. **In-band vs. Out-of-band**: Evaluation of exposing AMF metadata in-band or not.
    * [In-band vs Out-band](https://github.com/comunica/Experiments-AMF/tree/master/experiments/in_vs_out_band): AMF metadata is exposed either in-band with TPFs, or out-band, which requires an additional HTTP request by the client.
6. **False-positive Probabilities**: Evaluation of different AMF false-positive Probabilities.
    * [Probabilities](https://github.com/comunica/Experiments-AMF/tree/master/experiments/probabilities): Different AMF probabilities are used.
7. **Miscellaneous**
    * [Dataset sizes](https://github.com/comunica/Experiments-AMF/tree/master/experiments/dataset_sizes): The effect of a larger dataset size (x10) on AMF.
## Bulk execution

We execute these experiments on a separate dedicated _experiment machine_.
Afterwards, we analyze the results locallly on an _analysis machine_.

1. Experiment machine: `./run.sh`: Run _all_ experiments.
1. Experiment machine: `./collect.sh`: Compress all experimental results.
1. Analysis machine: `./download.sh`: Download the experimental results to the analysis machine.
1. Analysis machine: `./plot.sh`: Create plots from the results.
