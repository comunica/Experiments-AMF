To run this experiment, Comunica Bencher must be [installed](https://github.com/comunica/comunica-bencher#usage).

## Combinations

This experiment consists of multiple combinations, which,
after running `comunica-bencher prepare-data`, can be found in the `combination_*` folders.

| | `MATRIX_RATE_LIMIT` |
|-|-|
| combination_0 | `256k` |
| combination_1 | `512k` |
| combination_2 | `2048k` |
| combination_3 | `4096k` |

## Usage

Generate the dataset and queries:
